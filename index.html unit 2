      <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

      <ol>

      	<li type="1">Airbnb</li>

       <p>Interesting use of space on the homepage- the negative space above the fold is mainly is comprised of a video, which imparts a sense of discovery-essentially the brand's ethos. You can see this in action <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/airbnb" target="_blank">here</a></p>. 

       <li type="1">Vinomofo</li>

       <p> The element of size really comes into play here. The Facebook and email sign up tabs are very prominent and a focal point. Another clear focal point is the brand's ethos "Welcome to good vino, real mofos and the most epic wine deals on the planet" <a href="http://vinomofo.com/" target="_blank">here</a></p>. 

      </ol>
